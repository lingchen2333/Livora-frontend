# Livora Frontend

This is the frontend of **Livora**, an e-commerce furniture platform. The frontend is built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**, providing a fast, responsive, and modern user experience. You can find the backend [here](https://github.com/lingchen2333/Livora-backend).

## Tech Stack

- React (with Vite)

## Live Demo

ðŸ”— [https://shop-livora.netlify.app](https://shop-livora.netlify.app)

> **Note**: The backend is hosted on [Render](https://livora-backend-latest.onrender.com) using the free tier, which means it may take **5 min to spin up** after a period of inactivity. You may notice a short delay on the first request â€” this is expected behavior on free-tier Render services.

> **Image Search Feature (powered by OpenAI)**: This project includes a feature to **search for products by image** using OpenAI's CLIP model and a Chroma vector store. However, **this feature is currently disabled in the live demo** due to the high cost of deploying and hosting a persistent vector database. You can run it locally by following the instructions in the backend README.
